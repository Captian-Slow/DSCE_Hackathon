# DSCE_Hackathon #
The DSCE Hackathon project (1st place)

A REST platform for collaborative social effort and awareness.

The server is implemented in Node.js and Express.js, using mongoDB as a simple database to store user and task data.
The platform allows users to post a task to the platform, describing the issues to be solved, and with the help of a rating system, the most sought after tasks can be taken up by the community (NGO's, residents, etc).

### To Implement: ### 
* Ability to upload and store any form of media (images, video, documents).
* Rating system needs to be polished.
