# DSCE_Hackathon #
The **Do Something** DSCE Hackathon project (1st place)

A REST platform for collaborative social effort and awareness. **Do Something** refers to the idea of people taking an initiative to "Do Something" about thier surroundings insted of complaining by collaborative effort.

The server is implemented in Node.js and Express.js, using mongoDB as a simple database to store user and task data.
The platform allows users to post a task to the platform, describing the issues to be solved, and with the help of a rating system, the most sought after tasks can be taken up by the community (NGO's, residents, etc).

### To Implement: ### 
* Ability to upload and store any form of media (images, video, documents).
* Rating system needs to be polished.
